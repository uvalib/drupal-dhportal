# Code Review Summary - SAML Certificate Implementation

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### **1. Enhanced Certificate Management System**
- ✅ Created `scripts/manage-saml-certificates-enhanced.sh`
- ✅ Supports staging and production environments
- ✅ Integrates with existing encrypted key infrastructure
- ✅ Falls back to self-signed certificates for development

### **2. Directory Structure**
- ✅ Created `saml-config/certificates/staging/` and `production/`
- ✅ Created `saml-config/keys/staging/` and `production/`
- ✅ Added example certificate files

### **3. Deployment Pipeline Updates**
- ✅ Updated `deployspec.yml` with environment detection
- ✅ Added dynamic key path selection (staging vs production)
- ✅ Added terraform infrastructure directory support
- ✅ Created `scripts/deploy-saml-certificates.sh` for Ansible integration

### **4. Docker Container Updates**
- ✅ Updated `Dockerfile` to use enhanced certificate script
- ✅ Added copying of saml-config directory to container
- ✅ Fixed script paths and permissions

### **5. Certificate Generation Tools**
- ✅ Created `scripts/generate-saml-certificates.sh` for initial setup
- ✅ Generates CSRs for CA signing
- ✅ Creates self-signed certificates for testing

### **6. Documentation**
- ✅ Created comprehensive README files
- ✅ Added solution documentation
- ✅ Updated .gitignore for certificate security

## ⚠️ What's Still Missing/Needs Action

### **1. CRITICAL: Actual Certificates**
```bash
# Need to generate and obtain signed certificates:
./scripts/generate-saml-certificates.sh

# Then submit CSRs to UVA Certificate Authority:
# - saml-config/temp/staging/saml-sp-staging.csr
# - saml-config/temp/production/saml-sp-production.csr

# Store signed certificates in:
# - saml-config/certificates/staging/saml-sp.crt
# - saml-config/certificates/production/saml-sp.crt
```

### **2. Terraform Infrastructure Keys**
The current setup assumes you'll use the same private keys as SSH infrastructure, but you may want dedicated SAML keys:

**Option A: Use Existing SSH Keys (Current Implementation)**
- Reuse `dh-drupal-staging.pem` and `dh-drupal-production.pem`
- No additional key management needed

**Option B: Create Dedicated SAML Keys**
- Generate separate keys for SAML certificates
- Encrypt and store in terraform-infrastructure repo:
  - `dh.library.virginia.edu/staging/keys/saml-sp-staging.pem.cpt`
  - `dh.library.virginia.edu/production/keys/saml-sp-production.pem.cpt`

### **3. Ansible Playbook Integration**
Need to integrate certificate setup into `deploy_backend_1.yml`:
```yaml
# Add this task to your Ansible playbook:
- name: Setup SAML certificates
  script: scripts/deploy-saml-certificates.sh
  environment:
    DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT: "{{ deployment_env }}"
    TERRAFORM_INFRA_DIR: "{{ terraform_infra_path }}"
```

### **4. Environment Variable Configuration**
Update your deployment environment variables:
```bash
# For staging deployments
export DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT=staging

# For production deployments  
export DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### **5. Testing Requirements**
```bash
# Test the enhanced certificate script locally:
./scripts/manage-saml-certificates-enhanced.sh dev

# Test with Docker container:
docker build -f package/Dockerfile -t test-dhportal .
docker run --rm test-dhportal /opt/drupal/scripts/test-simplesamlphp.sh
```

## 🔄 Deployment Process (Final)

### **Development:**
1. ✅ Uses self-signed certificates automatically
2. ✅ No external dependencies

### **Staging:**
1. 🔄 Generate CSR and get certificate signed by UVA CA
2. 🔄 Store certificate in `saml-config/certificates/staging/saml-sp.crt`
3. ✅ Deploy using existing pipeline (uses staging infrastructure key)
4. ✅ Enhanced script automatically pairs key with certificate

### **Production:**
1. 🔄 Generate CSR and get certificate signed by UVA CA  
2. 🔄 Store certificate in `saml-config/certificates/production/saml-sp.crt`
3. ✅ Deploy using production pipeline (uses production infrastructure key)
4. ✅ Enhanced script automatically pairs key with certificate

## 🚨 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Generate CSRs**: Run `./scripts/generate-saml-certificates.sh`
2. **Submit to CA**: Send CSRs to UVA Certificate Authority
3. **Store Certificates**: Place signed certificates in git repo
4. **Test Build**: Build Docker container and verify certificate setup
5. **Deploy**: Test deployment to staging environment

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- ✅ Private keys never stored in git (encrypted in terraform repo)
- ✅ Public certificates safe to store in git
- ✅ Environment-specific certificate isolation
- ✅ Proper file permissions (600 for keys, 644 for certificates)
- ✅ CA-signed certificates for production use

The implementation is now complete and ready for certificate generation and testing!
